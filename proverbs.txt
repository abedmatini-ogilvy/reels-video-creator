Believe in yourself and all that you are.
Your only limit is your mind.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Champions keep playing until they get it right.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
